PicoAppz
========

Generator to build and manage the picoappz.com site. The site is just a showcase of projects and apps that I am working on.

## TODO

* Rebuild automatically on git push
* Rebuild from heroku cron?
* Rebuild when any other project hooked gets pushed
* Pull data from other apps or a configuration file. Not sure best place to get it
* Improve the look / design
* SSO for all shared picoAppz?
* Only push changed files, store last modified / updated date per file or something?
